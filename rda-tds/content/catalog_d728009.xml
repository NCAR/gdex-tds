    This dataset contains Version 3.2 of The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Daily Precipitation Data Set (GPCPDAY).  The variables included are precipitation and probability of liquid phase.
    
    
    As the follow-on to the GPCP Version 2.3 Monthly product and the Version 1.3 One Degree Daily product, GPCP Version 3 (GPCP V3.2) seeks to continue the long, homogeneous precipitation record using modern merging techniques and input data sets. The GPCP V3 suite currently consists of the 0.5-degree Monthly and 0.5-degree Daily. A follow-on 0.1-degree 3-hourly product is expected. All GPCPV3 products are constructed to be internally consistent. The Daily product spans June 2000 to the present, with roughly quarterly updates. 
    
    
    Inputs consist of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) estimates in the span 55 degrees North-South, and Television-Infrared Operational Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder / Advanced Infrared Sounder (TOVS/AIRS) estimates, adjusted climatologically to IMERG across the 55-degree latitude boundary, outside 55 degrees North-South. The Daily estimates are scaled to approximately sum to the Monthly value at each 0.5 degree grid box. In addition to the complete precipitation field, probability of liquid phase estimates are provided globally.
    
    
    GPCP Version 3 Daily was developed primarily under a current NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program (PI: Ali Behrangi, University of Arizona). The GPCP is computed as a contribution to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and Global Water and Energy Exchange (GEWEX) activities, and is part of the array of data sets describing the water and energy cycles of the planet. Prior versions of the GPCP analysis have been produced by a consortium of individual scientists at various government and university institutions and most recently as part of the NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) Program. The current GPCP Daily product described here creates a global daily satellite product using the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) half-hourly Final Run product at low and middle latitudes, and daily retrievals from Television InfraRed Operational Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at high latitudes, with calibration to the GPCP V3.2 Monthly SG product.

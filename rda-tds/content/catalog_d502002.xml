    This dataset contains the bias-corrected CPC MORPHing technique (CMORPH) global precipitation 
    analyses, version 1, and is obtained from the 
    NOAA Climate Data Record. 
    
    
    The following description is from the NOAA Climate Data Record CMORPH dataset page:
    
    
    This data set is for the bias-corrected, reprocessed CPC Morphing technique (CMORPH) 
    high-resolution global satellite precipitation estimates. The CMORPH satellite precipitation 
    estimates are created in two steps. First, the purely satellite-based global fields of 
    precipitation are constructed through integrating Level 2 retrievals of instantaneous 
    precipitation rates from all available passive microwave measurements aboard low earth 
    orbiting platforms. Bias in these integrated satellite precipitation estimates is 
    then removed through comparison against CPC daily gauge analysis over land and adjustment 
    against the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) merged analysis of pentad 
    precipitation over ocean. The bias corrected CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates are 
    created on an 8 km by 8 km grid over the global domain from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N 
    and in a 30-minute interval from January 1, 1998. Due to the delay of some input data sets, 
    this formal version (Version 1) bias corrected CMORPH is produced manually once a month at a 
    latency of 3-4 months.
    
    
    For the CDR production, the bias corrected CMORPH generated at its native resolution of 
    8 km by 8 km / 30-minute is upscaled to form THREE sets of data files of different 
    time/space resolution for improved user experience:
    
    
    a) the full-resolution CMORPH data
    Output variable: precipitation rate in mm/hour
    spatial resolution: 8 km by 8km (at equator)
    spatial coverage: global (60S-60N)
    temporal resolution: 30min
    data period: January 1, 1998 to the present
    
    
    b) Hourly CMORPH
    Output variable: precipitation rate in mm/hour
    spatial resolution: 0.25 degrees latitude/longitude
    spatial coverage: global (60S-60N)
    temporal resolution: hourly
    data period: January 1, 1998 to the present
    
    
    c) Daily CMORPH
    Output variable: daily precipitation in mm/day
    spatial resolution: 0.25 degrees latitude/longitude
    spatial coverage: global (60S-60N)
    temporal resolution: hourly
    data period: January 1, 1998 to the present
    
    
    (b) and (c) are derived from and quantitatively consistent with the CMORPH at its 
    original resolution (a).

      <documentation type="summary">A prototype, real-time, hourly, multi-sensor National Precipitation
    Analysis has been developed at the National Centers for Environmental
    Prediction (NCEP) in cooperation with the Office of Hydrology (OH). This
    analysis merges two data sources that are currently being collected in
    real-time by OH and NCEP.  Approximately 3000 automated, hourly rain gauge
    observations are available over the contiguous 48 states via the GOES
    Data Collection Platform, and ASOS.  In addition, hourly digital
    precipitation (HDP) radar estimates are obtained as compressed digital
    files via the AWIPS network. The HDP estimates are created by the WSR-88D
    Radar Product Generator on a 131 by 131 4 km grid centered over each
    radar site. The data analysis routines, including a bias correction of the
    radar estimates using the gage data, have been adapted by NCEP on a
    national 4 km grid from algorithms developed by OH ("Stage II") and
    executed regionally at NWS River Forecast Centers.Since January 1, 2002, the Stage IV analysis data became available and are added to the archive.
    This precipitation data are received through UCAR/EOL.</documentation>

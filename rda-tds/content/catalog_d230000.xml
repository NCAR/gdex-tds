      <documentation type="summary">Ship and buoy observed winds are used at FSU/COAPS to produce
    objectively analyzed grids of pseudo-wind stress for the
    tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean.
    
    Note: this version of ds230.0 data has
    been superseded.
    
    The Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at
    the Florida State University has a
    
    {new in-situ based air-sea flux product}.
    The product, known as the FSU3, is an objectively derived
    monthly surface flux product based only on individual ship,
    buoy, and drifter observations. Fields of sensible and
    latent heat flux, wind stress, pseudo-wind stress,
    and the parameters needed to derive these fluxes (wind speed,
    air and  sea temperature, specific humidity) are available.
    
    Currently, the FSU3 is available for the Atlantic Ocean
    (north of  34S) from 1978-2004 and for the Indian Ocean
    (north of 30S) from 1978-1997. An extension of the Indian Ocean
    through 2004 will be release shortly and the 1978-2004 Pacific
    product will be available by the end of 2006. All products are
    based on the ICOADS versions 2.1 (1978-1997) and version 2.2
    (1998-2004).</documentation>

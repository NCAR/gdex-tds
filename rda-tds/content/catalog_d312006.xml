      <documentation type="summary">MEGAN is a modeling system for estimating the net emission
    of gases and aerosols from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere.
    Emissions are calculated for about 200 chemical species including
    biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as isoprene,
    a-pinene, methanol and acetone as well as some inorganic compounds
    (e.g., NO and CO). The model is driven by land cover, weather, and
    atmospheric chemical composition and uses simple mechanistic
    algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling
    biogenic emissions. MEGAN is a global model with a base resolution of
    ~ 1 km. It can run as a stand-alone model for generating emission
    inventories but has also being incorporated as an on-line component of
    chemistry/transport and earth system models including the CESM
    Community Land Model and WRF-Chem. The model was originally developed
    at NCAR and is described by Guenther et al. 2012
    (https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1471/2012/). This dataset
    includes global 30 second (~1 km^2) resolution datasets of the three
    required MEGAN land cover inputs (ecotypes, Growth forms, Leaf Area
    Index) and some inputs (soil fertilizer, nitrogen and land type) for
    the optional soil NOx model.</documentation>

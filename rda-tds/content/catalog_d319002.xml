      <documentation type="summary">This dataset contains climate model output products from the
    United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
    Research (HCCPR).  The model output consists of monthly grids from five
    runs of HCCPR's HadCM2 model that were made in 1995.  These runs were a
    control (constant atmospheric forcing) run, two
    greenhouse gas runs which assumed a constant compounded
    percentage per year (either 0.5% or 1%) increase in
    CO2, and two aerosol runs which combined the
    CO2 and sulfate aerosol concentrations.  The model
    has a spatial resolution of 3.75-degree by 2.5-degree
    (96 by 73).
    DSS has computed decadal mean grids for each decade-month
    from the monthly mean grids.  The decade means are computed for
    years 0 through 9 of each decade.  We also computed smoothed
    decadal means by computing 30-year running means of the decadal
    mean grids.  Because of the large variability in the decadal
    means of variables such as precipitation, we recommend using the
    30-year (smoothed decadal) means and applying them to the year
    at the middle of the 30-year period (i.e. - the 30-year mean for
    2070-2099 should be applied at year 2085).</documentation>

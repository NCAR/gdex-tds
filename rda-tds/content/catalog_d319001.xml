      <documentation type="summary">The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis
    (CCCMA) has developed several climate simulation models for use
    in projecting natural climate change and assessing the impact of
    human activities on climate change.  CCCMA's first-generation
    global coupled model (CGCM1) was run with three scenarios: one
    with constant atmospheric forcing (control run), one with carbon
    dioxide (CO2) increasing at a compounded one percent per year
    rate, and one with a combination of CO2 and sulfate aerosol
    concentrations.
    The model was run at T32 resolution, resulting in a 97 by 48
    gaussian latitude/longitude grid with approximately 3.75 degree
    by 3.75 degree resolution.  Daily (once- or twice-daily
    depending on the parameter) and monthly output grids were
    produced.  Upper level (850mb and 500mb) parameters include
    geopotential heights, temperature, winds, and humidity.  At the
    surface, the model outputs include temperature, wind, humidity,
    pressure, sea-level pressure, precipitation, and radiation
    fluxes.
    DSS has used the monthly-mean grids to compute decadal means
    for years zero through nine (e.g. 2000-2009) for each decade.
    DSS also computed smoothed decadal means which are 30-year
    running means of the raw decadal means.  Because of the large
    variability in the decadal means of parameters such as
    precipitation, it is recommended that the smoothed decadal-mean
    grids be used and applied to the middle decade of the period
    (e.g. apply the 2000-2029 mean to the year 2015).</documentation>

      <documentation type="summary">This data set contains U.S. station surface observations
    that were digitized from the original forms by the Climate Database
    Modernization Program (CDMP).
    Data are available for more than 200 stations (mainly at
    airports, but also some city weather bureau offices) that made
    observations at hourly intervals at least during the daytime
    hours and often over the full 24-hour day.  The general period
    of record for these stations is 1928-1948, though this varies
    by individual station.  To find out what is available, see
    
    this inventory.  A significant effort was made by DSS to
    correct errors in the digitized data, especially dates, times,
    and pressures.  For more information about this work, see
    this
    document.
    We have also received data for more than 130 U.S. stations
    that were digitized from Form 1001.  These stations, which were
    usually city weather bureau offices, generally took
    observations once, twice, or four times daily.  Some stations
    have data back as far as late 1892.  An
    
    inventory can be viewed which shows stations and their
    date range coverage.  These data will be made available to the
    community when errors in the digitized data have been corrected.
